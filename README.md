**Abstract:**	When we recently built our new GIS website, we were searching for a way to better manage our metadata. At the time we had a data maintenance book in Word documents, plus a separate HTML data dictionary for our old website in addition to the standard SDE metadata. All of these were carrying similar information but needed to be edited individually. With the prospect of posting some of our data on GitHub, ArcGIS Online, and our Socrata data portal, we were looking at even more places to edit. 

In this presentation, we will demo our new data dictionary, which is generated directly from the XML metadata in our ArcSDE database, and we?ll show the process we used to build it. We'll also discuss our other ongoing efforts to consolidate our metadata into one single source.
